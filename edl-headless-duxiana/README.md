## How to Run
### Netlify Dev

- If you want to use [Netlify Dev](https://www.netlify.com/products/dev/) built-in feature for local development, you need to authorize the repo to run the local its setup first. To start, login first to Netlify by typing: `yarn netlify:login`. Follow the instructions that will follow. You only need to do this once. After authenticating, you can start running the site by typing `yarn netlify:start`. **Netlify Dev** will run its setup locally and afterwards run both `gatsby clean` and `gatsby develop` automatically. Open a browser tab/window and type `localhost:8888` to run the setup and start developing.

	> **Note**: When the `env` variables are already in the **Netlify** admin panel, `netlify dev` will load those into your local development environment instead. Adding `env` variables locally via the provided `.env.sample` file will instruct `netlify dev` to override the values and use those local `env` variables instead.

	- You can access the GraphQL Playground by visiting `localhost:8888/__graphql`, assuming you already run `yarn start` command.
### Gatsby CLI

- Start by typing `yarn gatsby:start`. This will run both `gatsby clean` and `gatsby develop` automatically. Open a browser tab/window and type `localhost:8000` to run the setup and start developing.

	> **Note**: Adding valid `env` variables locally via the provided `.env.sample` file is required for `gatsby develop` to run.

- You can access the GraphQL Playground by visiting `localhost:8000/__graphql`, assuming you already run `yarn start` command.
